# HopPyBar

A python program to import, analyze, and export Split-Hopkinson Pressure Bar (Kolsky Bar) data.

This program serves as a developmental platform to "whitebox" the data analysis process (in constrast to similar "blackbox" programs).

Data streams can be captured (in-situ) to enable advanced or unconventional analyses, statistics, and comparisons. General workflow will import SHPB data in one of a number of formats, identify relevant portions of data signals, and convert to stress-strain-strainrate to show material behavior as a function of dynamic testing. Dispersion correction functionality is built in. Several export options exist, with an option to add additional metadata for easier import to Granta (or similar) database. 

Created by Ben Morrow, Los Alamos National Laboratory. Originally based loosely on a previous analysis routine of Chris Meredith (ARL). Major contributions from Ginny Euser (LANL). Dispersion correction based on work of Anatolii Bragov (NNSTU).
